# Best practices

This is the *why* behind every check the audit runs. The governing rule:

> **Every best practice here has an enforcing check.** If we believe something,
> the tool proves it on every run. A practice with no check is a *gap* (tracked
> at the bottom) — not a best practice yet.

So this doc and `tools/checks/*` move together: you don't add a practice without
baking a test, and you don't add a test without writing down why. Real sites being audited are the source of new practices — each problem worth
preventing everywhere becomes a permanent check.

**Baseline assumed.** The baseline Astro stack: Astro 7+, `output: 'static'`,
Cloudflare delivery (Image Transformations for R2 content, immutable hashed
assets), and Cloudflare Web Analytics for measurement. The tool validates
compliance against this — it never sets anything up or migrates.

Two things left the baseline on **2026-08-03**, because both had become a wall
between a new site and a working one:

- **Search is optional.** It used to be a required dependency (`@orama/orama`),
  so a site that had deliberately shipped no search collected a finding for it.
  What binds now is coherence, not presence — see *Search* under `modules`.
- **Analytics is Cloudflare Web Analytics by default, not Zaraz.** Web Analytics
  is free, cookieless and needs no consent banner, so a site can be measured the
  day it deploys. Zaraz remains fully supported and fully documented below; it is
  the right answer when you need a tag *manager*, and it is a dashboard project
  before it is anything else. Nothing about analytics fails a run in either mode.

**Severities.** 🔧 fix = required, fails the run · 🛑 = needs a human decision ·
💡 = advisory suggestion, never fails · ⏭ = not testable in this mode.

**Universal vs house style.** Not every practice here binds every Astro site.
A check is **universal** when ignoring it means a real defect — a broken build, a
measurable performance or accessibility problem, or missing SEO fundamentals
every crawler and social preview depends on. It's **house style** when a
reasonable site could make a different call and still be well built: which search
library, which host's cache-header file, whether there's an RSS or `llms.txt`
endpoint at all.

By default only universal checks are required; house-style ones report as
`💡 … [baseline]` and don't fail the run. `--strict` requires everything, which
is the right mode once you've adopted the baseline deliberately. The
classification is one table in `tools/lib/policy.mjs` — **when you add a
practice, classify it there too**, or it silently defaults to universal and
starts failing strangers' builds.

There is a third, much smaller category: **advisory**. A handful of checks report
a *fact* rather than a verdict and have no `🔧`/`🛑` branch at all — `--strict`
does not promote them because there is nothing to promote. `analytics: provider`
is the one that matters. They are listed separately in `policy.mjs` so
`--rules` can label them `[advisory]` instead of `[universal]`, which would read
as "required by default".

## How we add a practice

When an audited site hits a problem worth preventing everywhere:

1. **Understand the requirement.** Read the underlying integration/service docs
   via `context7` (Astro, Cloudflare, the relevant plugin) — encode the real
   contract, not a guess. This is a hard rule for Astro/Cloudflare specifics.
2. **Write the practice here** — what it is and *why* (the failure it prevents).
3. **Bake the check** into `tools/checks/<domain>.mjs`. Reuse `tools/lib/`
   helpers; keep detection precise so it doesn't false-positive on a legitimate
   variant (e.g. per-locale naming, a factored predicate helper).
3b. **Classify it** in `tools/lib/policy.mjs` — universal practice, or this
   project's house style? Unclassified means universal, which means it fails the
   build of every stranger who doesn't share the opinion. Ask: could a
   well-built Astro site reasonably do this differently?
4. **Verify.** `node tools/audit.mjs` in **both** `examples/_fixture-i18n/` and
   `examples/starter/` must stay
   `0 🔧 / 0 🛑` (in both default and `--strict`), and run it against at least one real site (drift there is expected and
   informational — it's how we confirm the check fires on the wild case).
5. **Ship it.** The check is now permanent.

Detection should accept *correct variants*, not just one spelling. The two
worst things a check can do are miss a real violation and flag a compliant site;
both erode trust in the tool, so a new practice isn't done until it's been run
against a known-good site and a known-bad one.

**Every outcome names its evidence — passes included.** `✅ seo: no-keywords`
with nothing after it is indistinguishable from a check that ran over zero files
and reported success, which is this tool's worst failure mode wearing a tick.
Say what was looked at and how much of it (`not emitted by any of the 23 source
file(s) under src/`). `tools/test.mjs` asserts this as an invariant over the
whole fixture run, so a new check cannot quietly reintroduce a mute pass.

---

## modules — the baseline stack is present and wired

*Check file: `tools/checks/modules.mjs`. Source: `package.json`, `astro.config.*`,
`tsconfig.json`.*

- **Astro 7+.** Baseline features (content layer, `astro:assets`, current config
  shape) assume a modern Astro, and v7 is where the stack now sits: the Rust
  compiler, the Sätteri markdown pipeline, and Vite 8. Staying on 6.x means
  running a superseded compiler and markdown pipeline, and the v7-only config
  surface below can't be relied on. → `modules: astro:version`
  *(Baseline moved 6.3 → 7 on 2026-08-01; Astro 7.0 shipped 2026, latest 7.1.6.
  Migration guide: `docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v7`.)*
- **Node ≥ 22.12.0.** Astro 7's own `engines.node` floor — a lower declared
  floor lets a build land on a runtime Astro won't start on. →
  `modules: engines.node`
- **TypeScript ≤ 6.x while `@astrojs/check` is installed.** TS 7 is published as
  npm `latest`, but `@astrojs/check` peers on `typescript ^5 || ^6` — installing
  TS 7 breaks `astro check`, which is the type gate the baseline relies on. Pin
  `^6` until the peer range widens. → `modules: typescript:version`
- **Baseline integrations installed:** `@astrojs/mdx`, `@astrojs/sitemap`,
  `@astrojs/rss`, `@astrojs/check`. Each backs a downstream practice (RSS feed,
  sitemap, type-checking). → `modules: dep:<name>`

  `astro-robots-txt` was on this list and no longer is. The practice is that the
  build *ships* a robots.txt pointing at the sitemap — a generated endpoint does
  that at least as well as the package, and collides with it if you have both.
  Requiring the package tested our habit, not the outcome. → `seo: robots`

  `@orama/orama` left the list on 2026-08-03 for a different reason: it was
  requiring a *feature*, not an integration. See below.
- **Search is optional; two search engines is not.** A content site of a few
  dozen pages is served fine by the browser's own find-in-page, and shipping an
  index it never uses is bundle weight for nothing. So no search library at all
  is `⏭` — there is nothing to check. One is fine whichever it is: Orama is the
  baseline's, and gets `✅`; Pagefind, Fuse, Lunr, Algolia and the rest get a
  `💡` saying so and nothing more.

  What is a defect on anyone's site is *two* engines installed at once — two
  indexes to build, two bundles to ship, and two different answers to the same
  query. That is the only branch that still reports `🔧`.
  → `modules: search:engine` (pairs with `data: search:index`)

  This is what "softening" has to mean if it is to be honest: the requirement
  moved from *presence* to *coherence*. Dropping the dependency without moving
  `data: search:index` to match would have removed the check entirely, so a site
  could ship a search box wired to nothing and hear about it from nobody.
- **A fully static build.** `output` defaults to `'static'` (Astro configuration
  reference, verified 2026-08-02), so *omitting* it is correct and only an
  explicit `output: 'server'` is a departure. The check used to flag any config
  that didn't spell it out — a required finding for writing less config than
  necessary. → `modules: output:static`
- **Rendering on demand means an adapter — any adapter.** A route that renders
  per-request needs one, and without it the build fails outright. The trap is
  that "renders on demand" is *not* the same as `output: 'server'`: a single
  `export const prerender = false` page in an otherwise static site is enough,
  and that is exactly the shape a contact form takes. The check tests for both,
  and names the route it found rather than just the output mode.

  It accepts **any** adapter — Cloudflare, Node, Vercel, Netlify, Deno, or a
  third-party one declared as `adapter:` in `astro.config`. The build fails
  identically on all of them, so naming ours would be house style wearing a
  universal badge. Classified universal for the same reason: a build that cannot
  run is a defect on anyone's site. → `modules: adapter:on-demand`
- **The Cloudflare adapter specifically, only for on-demand `<Image>`.** On a
  fully prerendered build, `astro:assets`' `<Image>` is optimized at *build time*
  by Sharp and emitted to `dist/` — no adapter exists or is needed. The Cloudflare
  image service only matters where pages render on demand *on Workers*, since
  Sharp can't run there.

  This check used to test `output: 'server'` alone, which was a false negative
  with real consequences: a static build with one `prerender = false` page using
  `<Image>` renders on Workers and was never flagged. Widened to the same
  on-demand definition as above. When there is no adapter at all it defers —
  `adapter:on-demand` already reports that, and one defect should produce one
  finding. → `modules: adapter:cloudflare`
- **Set `imageService` explicitly, or you may be buying something.** The
  Cloudflare adapter's `imageService` default changed from `'compile'` to
  `'cloudflare-binding'` (Astro's Cloudflare adapter docs, verified 2026-08-03).
  That service transforms images at runtime through the Cloudflare Images
  binding, which is *"automatically provisioned upon deployment"* — a paid
  product. So installing the adapter for something unrelated (a contact form,
  say) can silently move image transforms from free build-time Sharp onto a
  billed runtime service, with nothing in the build output saying so.

  A `💡` rather than a `🔧`: `'cloudflare-binding'` is a legitimate choice, and
  the only defect is making it by accident. Fires only when the adapter and
  `<Image>` are both present. → `modules: adapter:imageService`
- **Strict TypeScript.** `extends: astro/tsconfigs/strict` catches whole classes
  of content/schema bugs at build. → `modules: tsconfig:strict`
- **`<ClientRouter />` in the root layout.** View transitions / SPA-style nav. →
  `modules: ClientRouter`
- **Webfonts through Astro's own fonts API, not a font CDN.** `fonts:` in
  `astro.config` plus `<Font />` from `astro:assets` self-hosts the files,
  generates fallback metrics so the swap doesn't shift layout, and emits the
  preload link. A `fonts.googleapis.com` stylesheet costs an extra DNS+TLS
  round-trip on the critical path, ships no fallback metrics, and discloses every
  visitor's IP to the font host. Advisory by default — which fonts you use, and
  how, is a defensible choice. → `modules: fonts`
- **Custom `src/pages/404.astro`.** A branded 404, not the host default. →
  `modules: 404:custom`
- **Media domain in `image.remotePatterns`.** R2-hosted content (`media.<domain>`)
  must be allowlisted or transforms/`<Image>` on it fail. (Only checkable when
  `scripts/og.config.mjs` declares the media domain.) → `modules: remotePatterns`

### Astro 7 migration residue

Config and imports that were valid on Astro 6 and are *wrong* on 7 — the kind of
thing a version bump leaves behind. Each maps to a documented v7 breaking change.

- **No stabilized flags left under `experimental:`.** v7 promoted `logger`,
  `cache`, `routeRules`, `queuedRendering`, `rustCompiler` and `advancedRouting`
  out of experimental. Left in the `experimental` block they are unknown config
  keys, not harmless no-ops — `logger`/`cache`/`routeRules` move to the top
  level, the other three are simply the default now. →
  `modules: astro7:experimental`
- **Unified()-only markdown options are backed by `@astrojs/markdown-remark`.**
  v7 renders Markdown with Sätteri and no longer installs that package. The
  deprecated `markdown.remarkPlugins` / `rehypePlugins` / `remarkRehype` options
  still work, but *only* with it installed and `markdown.processor: unified()`
  set; otherwise the plugins silently never run. Sites with no remark/rehype
  plugins need nothing — Sätteri applies GFM and SmartyPants like before. →
  `modules: astro7:markdown`
- **No `@astrojs/db`.** The package was removed in v7 and is unmaintained. Use
  `node:sqlite`, Drizzle, or a hosted DB. → `modules: astro7:db`
- **No removed `astro:transitions` internals.** `TRANSITION_*` constants,
  `isTransitionBeforePreparationEvent()`, `isTransitionBeforeSwapEvent()` and
  `createAnimationScope()` are gone; use the lifecycle event names directly
  (`'astro:before-preparation'`, `'astro:after-swap'`, …). An import of a removed
  export is a build failure, so this catches it before deploy. →
  `modules: astro7:transitions`
- **`compressHTML` is set explicitly.** v7 changed the default from `true` to
  `'jsx'`, which strips whitespace by JSX rules — including the newline between
  prose and an inline element. Measured on astro@7.1.6:

  ```astro
  Tasman Visa operates the website
  <a href="…">tasmanvisa.com</a>. Your privacy is important to us.
  ```

  builds as `operates the websitetasmanvisa.com.` with the default, and keeps the
  space with `compressHTML: true`. It builds clean, typechecks clean, and is
  wrong only in the rendered text — tasmanvisa-web had it live on their privacy
  page. → `modules: compressHTML`

  The check accepts **either value**. What it refuses is the field being unset,
  because inheriting a changed default is not choosing one. The baseline itself
  takes `true`: a content site is exactly where prose meets inline elements
  constantly.
- **`tsconfig.json`'s own `exclude` still covers `dist`.** Astro's shipped
  tsconfigs exclude it, but a project that declares its own `exclude` *replaces*
  that list rather than adding to it, and `astro check` then type-checks the
  built bundle. cypruspokerbrisbane got ~70 spurious warnings out of a built
  `chart.js` this way, and 0/0/0 once `dist` went back in. No `exclude` at all is
  correct and passes. → `modules: tsconfig:exclude-dist`
- **The upgrade is verified mechanically, not by reading.** The guide is 333
  pages and the two changes above are both silent, so `astro:version`'s fix hint
  now carries the procedure that actually caught them: build on the old version,
  snapshot `dist/`, upgrade, rebuild, and diff the rendered visible text **with
  tags stripped to empty** — not to a space, which masks precisely the
  `compressHTML` change. That took tasmanvisa-web from "hope it is fine" to "332
  of 333 pages byte-identical, and the one difference is a fix".

## seo — the discoverability surface

*Check file: `tools/checks/seo.mjs`. Source: `src/components/SEO.astro`,
`scripts/og.config.mjs`, `astro.config.*`. (Structured data lives under `data`.)*

- **One SEO component emits canonical + OG.** Every page gets a
  consistent head surface from a single component, not ad-hoc per-page tags:
  `canonical`, `og:image`, `og:image:width`/`height`, `og:type`, `og:url`.
  (Twitter/X falls back to the OG tags, so a dedicated `twitter:card` isn't
  required.) → `seo: meta:<tag>` (offline, scans the component source) +
  `seo: og:<tag>` (live, the rendered `<head>`)
- **The og:image is a real card, not just a 200.** A resolvable image URL
  (status + `image/*` content-type) is necessary but not sufficient: a generator
  that screenshots an *error* page uploads a perfectly valid PNG. That's the
  an incident on a real site incident — a site on `trailingSlash:'always'` had its generator
  request the no-trailing-slash `/preview/og/<slug>` → 404 → it screenshotted
  and shipped Astro's 404 page as the post's OG card, and status+content-type
  alone never caught it. The live check fetches the served bytes and verifies the
  intrinsic dimensions: at least the OG minimum (600×315, below which platforms
  crop or reject), and matching the declared `og:image:width`/`height`. →
  `seo: og:image:card` (live; 💡 `og:image:dimensions` when served ≠ declared).
  *Boundary:* the same-viewport case (a 404 shot at the real 1200×630 viewport)
  is indistinguishable from headers/bytes — the fix for that is a `resp.ok()`
  guard in the **generator** (assert a 200 before screenshotting), which lives in
  the audited site, not here. rider documents the practice; the site
  implements the guard.
- **The head meta is on every published page, not merely somewhere.** Coverage
  is measured over the pages the **sitemap** declares — the site's own answer to
  "what am I publishing". Every other denominator is wrong: "every file in
  `dist/`" counts OG-image templates and preview routes that correctly carry no
  canonical, and "pages that have a canonical" (which is what `isContentPage`
  means) makes the canonical check measure itself — delete the canonical from 18
  of 19 pages and the set shrinks to 1, which reports 1/1 ✅. A dogfood agent
  reproduced exactly that. All → pass, none → fix, some → 💡 naming the pages.
  → `seo: meta:*`
- **`og:image:width`/`height` are advice, not a requirement.** A card renders
  without them; they only let a platform reserve space before fetching it. Two
  independently-built, well-made dogfood sites had these two as their *only*
  required finding — which is the signal that the severity was wrong rather than
  the sites. → `seo: meta:og:image:width`, `seo: meta:og:image:height` (💡)
- **Each page's canonical is its own URL.** Presence is not enough: a site where
  twenty pages all declared the same canonical passed, and that markup asks
  crawlers to drop nineteen of them as duplicates — strictly worse than having no
  canonical at all. Only a value covering *more than half* the pages is reported,
  and only as advice, because deliberate duplicates are legitimate: the bundled
  i18n fixture shares a canonical between a locale fallback rewrite and the page
  it mirrors, which is correct. → `seo: canonical:unique`
- **No `<meta name="keywords">`.** Ignored by search engines and a weak spam
  signal — its presence is the anti-pattern. → `seo: no-keywords`
- **Brand fields set:** `siteName`, `siteUrl`, `tagline` feed the SEO meta. →
  `seo: brand.<field>` (and 💡 `brand:optional` for author/twitter handles)
- **`robots.txt` served, pointing at the sitemap.** The built site must carry a
  `robots.txt` with a `Sitemap:` line — that line is how a crawler that starts at
  the root finds the full URL list. Read from `dist/robots.txt`, so any way of
  producing it counts: an endpoint, a `public/` file, or an integration.
  → `seo: robots` (`⏭` with no `dist/`)
- **Sitemap carries lastmod.** Read from the built `sitemap*.xml`: how many
  `<url>` entries carry a `<lastmod>`. `@astrojs/sitemap` emits none unless a
  `serialize()` supplies one (verified against the integration docs), so the
  integration being configured proves nothing — the old check inferred it from
  `astro.config` and passed two dogfood sites whose sitemaps had zero `lastmod`.
  Advisory: a crawler tolerates its absence, it just can't tell what changed.
  → `seo: sitemap:lastmod` (`⏭` with no `dist/`)
- **Exactly one `<h1>` per content page.** The `<h1>` is the page title; zero
  means no main heading, more than one dilutes the document outline for search
  engines and screen readers. Checked on built `dist/` HTML (pages with a
  canonical link — so OG-template / preview routes are excluded) and live on
  home + a content page. → `seo: headings:h1` (required)
- **Don't skip heading levels.** A sequential outline (h2→h3→h4, never h2→h4)
  is a WCAG 1.3.1 expectation. Advisory, not required — a skip is most often a
  shared header/footer using a deeper level, not a content bug, so it shouldn't
  fail an otherwise-clean run. → 💡 `seo: headings:order`

  **The finding names the component, not the built page.** Reporting
  `dist/wiki/index.html` for a level written in a shared layout leaves the reader
  the actual work — the built page is where it showed up, the component is what
  they have to edit. The offending heading's *text* is matched back against
  `src/`, and a location is claimed only when **exactly one** source file
  matches: a heading rendered from frontmatter (`<h2>{title}</h2>`) has no
  literal to find, and two components sharing a heading text are ambiguous. Both
  fall back to the built path, because a confidently wrong pointer is worse than
  the artifact.

## images — content images delivered well

*Check files: `tools/checks/images.mjs` (offline: source + built `dist/`) and
`tools/checks/live.mjs` (served HTML). Shared param logic: `tools/lib/cf-image.mjs`.*

- **Content images go through an image transform.** Either Astro build-time
  optimization for local assets (`/_astro/…`) or Cloudflare Image
  Transformations for R2 content (`/cdn-cgi/image/…`) — never a raw full-size
  `<img>` to the media domain. → `images: routed`, `images: background-image`
- **No oversized rasters at the source or in the build.** A >500 KB PNG/JPG in
  `src/assets/`, or a >300 KB content image in `dist/`, means something never got
  resized. → `images: assets:size`, `images: dist:size`

  **A responsive image is judged as a ladder, not as files.** The browser
  downloads exactly one rung of a `srcset`, so the budget applies to the
  *smallest* rung — what a phone actually gets — not to the largest. Flagging the
  top rung was a false positive with no legal fix: Astro emits the intrinsic
  width unconditionally (`image.breakpoints` only adds widths *below* it), so the
  only way to satisfy it was to downscale the source and degrade retina desktop
  to improve a number no user experiences. A ladder is a defect when even its
  smallest rung is over budget; a single image referenced by no `srcset` is still
  judged on its own bytes. Ladders are read out of the built HTML — an `<img>`'s
  `srcset` plus its `src` fallback, and each `<source>` in a `<picture>`.
  Reported by `tasmanvisa-web`, 2026-08-02.
- **A CSS background does not pin a width.** `background-image` gets neither
  `srcset` nor lazy loading, and neither is recoverable: whatever width is
  hardcoded is what every device downloads, and the fetch starts as soon as the
  rule matches an element — so cards four screens down compete with the LCP image
  for bandwidth. tasmanvisa-web had `QuoteCTA` pinned at `width=1600`, so phones
  fetched a 1600 px photo for a 393 px viewport; the home page shipped ~1.1 MB of
  CSS backgrounds and audited `images ✅ all`. Converting 19 of them took that
  page from 1834 KB to 925 KB. → `images: background-image:fixed-width`

  The fix is an absolutely-inset `<img>` with `srcset`/`sizes`/`loading="lazy"`
  inside a positioned parent. `image-set()` is exempt — it does DPR selection,
  which is less than an `<img>` gets but more than nothing. Scanned in source
  rather than `dist/`, because the fix is a template edit and that is where the
  finding should point. Widths under 640 px are not flagged: a pinned width that
  small is roughly what a phone wants anyway, and flagging a decorative texture
  is the noise that gets a tool ignored.
- **A large image ships a ladder, not one fixed width.** Everything above judges
  responsive images that already exist — the smallest rung of a `srcset`, a CSS
  background that can never have one, an overstated `sizes` measured in a
  browser. None of them says the thing that is arguably worth more: *this image
  is large and ships as a single width, so every phone downloads the desktop
  file*. That is this check. → 💡 `images: srcset:missing`

  A candidate is a built `<img>` with no `srcset` and no `<picture>` ancestor
  (its `<source>` siblings are the ladder) whose delivered width is knowable —
  the width a `/cdn-cgi/image/` URL pins, or the intrinsic width of the file it
  resolves to in `dist/`. PNG, JPEG, WebP and AVIF are all readable from their
  own bytes (`tools/lib/image-size.mjs`); a remote host is unknowable offline,
  and an unknown width is never a finding.

  AVIF was the exception until issue #21, and it was the expensive kind of
  silence: a build that emits avif produced `⏭ nothing to check` — the same line
  a site with no images gets — because every candidate's width was unreadable.
  Reading it means walking ISOBMFF boxes to the `ispe` the primary item claims,
  not the first one in the file, since a thumbnail or an alpha plane carries its
  own and taking the wrong one understates the width the browser paints.

  **The trap, and why this took three attempts to ship.** A legitimately
  fixed-width image is common and *correct*: a logo, an avatar, an icon, a
  diagram rendered at exactly one size. Flagging those is the crying-wolf
  failure `tools/lib/policy.mjs` exists to prevent, and it is worse than not
  having the check. So the thresholds are measured rather than chosen. Across
  three real builds (tasmanvisa-web, matevisky-web, mergodon-com-web), every
  single-width image that was *meant* to be one came in at ≤ 720 px — badge
  strips at 200–300, portraits at 240–640, footer logos at 220 — while every one
  that should have had a ladder was a 1200–1600 px photograph. Hence **1000 px**,
  which sits in the empty gap between the two populations rather than at a round
  number someone liked. Two further guards cover the wide-but-legitimate case: a
  **50 KB** floor when the bytes are knowable (the same build's 1594 px brand
  lockups are 21 and 25 KB, while its wide photographs start at 46 KB), and a
  name filter for `logo`/`lockup`/`badge`/`icon`/`avatar`-shaped paths. Each of
  the two real false positives the sweep produced is excluded by *both*.

  Exempted images are counted, not discarded, so the pass line can say "none
  needed a ladder (2 of them wider than 1000px, but …)" instead of implying
  nothing wide was there — which would be a false statement about precisely the
  images the guards exist for.

  **Advisory in every mode**, and that is the shipping condition issue #12 set:
  it earns a `🔧` only if a wider real-site sweep shows it staying quiet on
  correct code. The measured sweep so far: silent on tasmanvisa-web (9 candidates,
  0 findings) and matevisky-web (7, 0); 7 true findings on mergodon-com-web, all
  blog and hero photographs pinned to a single desktop width.
- **Transforms use `format=auto`, not an explicit format.** `format=auto` lets
  Cloudflare negotiate AVIF/webp per the browser's `Accept`; an explicit
  `format=webp` (the default Astro emits for bare markdown `![]()`) means no AVIF
  *and* a raw-source fallback for clients that don't accept that format (via
  `onerror=redirect`). → `images: transform:format` (offline + live)
- **Transforms set an explicit `quality=`.** Cloudflare defaults to 85; an
  explicit cap (e.g. `quality=80`) is usually a large win on photographic
  content. Advisory. → 💡 `images: transform:quality`
- **Measure served bytes the way a browser sees them.** The live byte check
  sends a real `Accept: image/avif,image/webp,…` so a `format=auto` transform
  negotiates the format an actual visitor downloads — not the raw source a
  headerless probe would trigger. → `images: bytes` (live)
- **Content images carry alt text.** Every content `<img>` needs an `alt`
  attribute (WCAG 1.1.1). `alt=""` is allowed — it signals a decorative image —
  but a *missing* attribute is the violation. `<Image>` from astro:assets
  enforces this at build; raw `<img>` and bare markdown can slip through.
  Checked on built `dist/` HTML and live. → `images: alt` (required)

  Every `<img>` tag counts, on every page. The check used to de-duplicate by
  `src` across the whole build, so the *first* occurrence of an image decided the
  verdict for all of them: the same photo used with alt on the homepage and
  without alt on a post was reported as fine. Four of five independent dogfood
  builds found that — a silent false negative with exit 0, which is the worst
  outcome this tool has. Each offending page is now its own finding, named.

## perf — page-speed levers

*Check file: `tools/checks/perf.mjs` (offline) and cache checks in
`tools/checks/live.mjs` (served).*
- **Hashed assets are immutable.** `public/_headers` marks `/_astro/*`
  `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` so repeat visits don't re-validate every
  JS/CSS/font. (A plain `astro dev` server doesn't apply `_headers` — the live
  check needs `wrangler dev` of `dist/` or the deployed site.) →
  `perf: _headers:/_astro/*`, live `perf: cache:_astro`
- **HTML revalidates.** HTML routes must *not* be immutable, or deploys won't
  show until the cache expires. → live `perf: cache:html`
- **Content `<img>` carry width + height.** Explicit dimensions (or `<Image>`,
  which bakes them) prevent layout shift (CLS). → `perf: cls:img-dimensions`,
  live `images: cls`

  **…unless CSS takes the image out of flow, in which case demanding them is
  cargo cult.** An absolutely-positioned image has no siblings to push, and
  `inset: 0` + `height: 100%` override the intrinsic-ratio box the attributes
  would establish — adding them changes nothing a browser does. Both checks now
  read the project's CSS (`<style>` blocks and `.css` under `src/` offline;
  the page's linked stylesheets when `--url`) and skip an `<img>` whose class,
  id or inline style puts it at `position: absolute`/`fixed`.

  This is not a corner case, it is the shape rider's *own* advice produces:
  `images: background-image` pushes a site off CSS backgrounds, and the
  replacement it names is precisely an absolutely-inset `object-fit: cover`
  `<img>` — so the more compliant the site, the more of these it has.
  tasmanvisa-web reported 20 of them, **20 of the 21 required findings in the
  whole live run**, on a page rider itself measured at CLS 0.001 (`browser`) and
  0 (`lighthouse`). A heuristic that a measurement in the same run contradicts
  that loudly is a bug in the heuristic. The reader is a selector scan, not a
  cascade — it answers the weaker "does any rule take this out of flow?" and errs
  toward silence, because missing one shifting image costs a finding while crying
  wolf twenty times costs the domain its credibility (`tools/lib/css-flow.mjs`).

  The live finding is also **aggregated**, one line naming a count and an
  example, not one per tag. A shared component puts the same defect on every card
  on the page; twenty findings for one fix is what buried the other one.

- **Render-blocking CSS stays small.** Measured on the *heaviest single page*:
  the bytes of every `<link rel="stylesheet">` it pulls plus its inlined
  `<style>` blocks. Per page, not per `dist/` — Astro emits a stylesheet per
  route, so a 484-page site legitimately has dozens of `.css` files while any one
  page links two, and totalling the directory would punish a site for having
  pages. `💡` over 100 KB, `🔧` over 250 KB. Four real Astro builds measured
  8–25 KB on their heaviest page, so the soft budget has four times the headroom
  a well-built site needs and the hard one only catches an unpurged framework.
  → `perf: css:bytes`
- **Few render-blocking stylesheets.** Each one is a separate round-trip before
  first paint. `💡` over 3 on a single page (the measured sites sit at 1–2).
  House style. → `perf: css:files`
- **Fonts stay light.** Total `.woff2`/`.woff`/`.ttf`/`.otf` bytes in `dist/`:
  `💡` over 200 KB, `🔧` over 500 KB (measured sites: 42 KB and 107 KB). Two
  families is enough for a content site — one for headings, one for body — and a
  variable font covers a whole weight range in one file.
  → `perf: font:bytes`, `perf: font:families` (`💡` over 2),
  `perf: font:faces` (`💡` over 4)

  **Counting `@font-face` needs two corrections**, both found by measuring real
  builds rather than reasoning about them. Blocks are deduped *by content*: Astro
  inlines the same block into every page's `<style>`, so a naive count returned
  2904 for one 484-page site. And Astro's Fonts API emits a second face per
  family carrying fallback metrics, whose `font-family` contains `fallback:` —
  counting those as real families reported both correctly-configured two-font
  sites as having four, which is exactly the false positive that gets a tool
  uninstalled.
- **woff2, not ttf/otf.** Universally supported for years and roughly half the
  bytes. Serving a raw font format to browsers is a defect on anyone's site, so
  this one is universal. → `perf: font:format`
- **Every declared family is one that can actually paint.** A family in
  `fonts[]` whose `cssVariable` never *leads* a `font-family` stack can only
  render if the font ahead of it fails to load — which, for a self-hosted,
  preloaded webfont, means never. It is downloaded eagerly on every page anyway.
  tasmanvisa-web had `Inter` sitting second behind `Sora`: **277 KB**, 143 KB of
  it italic faces nothing referenced. → `perf: font:unused-family`

  Neither this nor the next one shows up in a byte total, which is why
  `font:bytes` passed the whole time: the total was correct, the *composition*
  was wrong. The correct fallback is the metric-adjusted local one Astro already
  generates (`optimizedFallbacks`, on by default), not a second webfont.

  A variable that appears in no stack at all is `💡` rather than `🔧` — the
  weaker evidence of the two, since it could equally be a gap in how the tool
  reads the CSS.
- **A family that never renders italic says so.** `styles` defaults to
  `['normal', 'italic']` — read off `astro/dist/assets/fonts/constants.js` in
  astro@7.1.6, not recalled — so declaring a family without it silently doubles
  its file count. Three of tasmanvisa's four families were shipping italic files
  for nothing. → `perf: font:styles`

  `🔧` only when the built output renders no italic *at all*. `<em>`, `<i>` and
  `<cite>` are italic from the UA stylesheet with no CSS involved, so testing for
  `font-style: italic` alone would flag every blog with emphasis in its prose;
  when any of those is present the finding drops to `💡`.

  **The fix hints name family × style × subset, never "drop unused weights".**
  Weights are free with a variable font — Sora 300–700 is one file — so pruning
  them is wasted effort, and advice to do it would be actively misleading. Nor is
  `subsets` safe to trim on a bilingual site: `latin-ext` is mandatory for
  Hungarian ő/ű.
- **Heavy third-party embeds sit behind a facade.** A Maps, YouTube, Vimeo,
  Spotify, Calendly or Typeform `<iframe>` pulls hundreds of kilobytes over
  dozens of requests from an origin you don't control, and it starts the moment
  the page loads. The fix is a facade: render a static placeholder — an image, or
  a styled box with a play button — and inject the real `<iframe>` from an
  `IntersectionObserver` when the reader scrolls near it. → `perf: embed:eager`

  **`loading="lazy"` is not a substitute, and the check deliberately does not
  accept it.** Native lazy loading only defers frames far enough down the page.
  On cypruspokerbrisbane.com (2026-05-31) the Maps `output=embed` iframe was in
  the *second section* — inside the threshold — so the attribute was present and
  the ~360 KB across ~20 requests was fetched anyway. Under PageSpeed's simulated
  Slow-4G that saturated bandwidth before first paint: mobile Performance 70,
  FCP 3.5 s, LCP 5.5 s. Behind an IntersectionObserver facade the same page
  measured 97 / 1.5 s / 2.0 s.

  Detection is "is the frame in the built HTML at all", because a facade injects
  it at runtime and so leaves nothing to find. Markup a browser does not fetch is
  excluded first — `<template>` (inert, and exactly what a facade clones) and
  `<noscript>` (the correct no-JS fallback *for* a facade) — since flagging those
  would report the fix as the defect. The host table lives in
  `tools/lib/embed-hosts.mjs`; a same-origin or small third-party frame is not
  what this is about.
- **Cross-origin image hosts are preconnected.** A browser only starts DNS + TLS
  for a host once it parses a URL pointing at it, so on a 150 ms-RTT mobile link
  that is several round trips of dead time before a byte of the LCP image moves.
  tasmanvisa-web served every blog hero and card from `media.tasmanvisa.com` with
  no preconnect anywhere: blog index LCP **5424 ms**, ~3500 ms once a preconnect
  plus a matching head preload were added — and the audit reported `perf ✅ all`
  throughout. → `perf: preconnect`

  A host serving one incidental image (an avatar, a badge) is `💡`, not `🔧`:
  the advice is still right, but it is not what cost 900 ms, and failing a build
  over it is the crying-wolf failure `policy.mjs` exists to prevent.
- **A preconnect to an image host carries `crossorigin`.** Images are CORS-mode
  fetches, so a bare `<link rel="preconnect">` opens an anonymous connection the
  image cannot reuse and the browser opens a second. It is a separate finding
  precisely because it *looks* fixed — the worse state to be in than missing.
  → `perf: preconnect:crossorigin`
- **A preload for an image matches the tag byte for byte.** A head
  `<link rel="preload" as="image">` whose `imagesrcset`/`imagesizes` differ from
  the `<img>`'s `srcset`/`sizes` makes the browser resolve two different
  candidates and download the image twice, so the preload leaves the page slower
  than no preload at all. → `perf: preload:pair`

  **A `srcset` is not `split(',')`, and getting that wrong made this check fire
  on correct code.** A candidate URL may contain commas, and on the delivery this
  baseline recommends it always does:
  `/cdn-cgi/image/width=800,format=auto,quality=80/hero.webp` shattered into
  three fragments, one of which — `format=auto` — was shared by *every*
  transformed image on the page. Pairing a preload to an `<img>` by shared
  fragment then matched an arbitrary unrelated image, whose srcset naturally
  differed, and the check reported a mismatch on a byte-identical pair. Worse, it
  routed around the no-match branch that exists exactly for the reporter's case:
  a preload whose image is a CSS `background-image` has no `<img>` to pair with,
  and "not something a static read can call a defect" was the correct outcome.
  All srcset reading now goes through one spec-shaped parser
  (`srcsetUrls` in `tools/lib/html.mjs`) — a URL is a run of non-whitespace and
  only a *trailing* comma ends a candidate, exactly as a browser reads it.
  Reported by tasmanvisa-web.

  Which page is "cross-origin" is decided per page from its own canonical link
  (falling back to `site:` in astro.config): a page declaring neither is not
  counted, because guessing the site's origin from the build would invent
  findings on a site that renders absolute self-URLs.
- **`sizes` describes the box, not the ambition.** `sizes`, not the layout, is
  what picks the srcset rung — so `sizes="100vw"` on a card that renders at
  355 px in a 393 px viewport makes the browser fetch 1280w/167 KB where
  1000w/133 KB was correct. This needs a rendered measurement, so it lives in the
  `browser` domain: when an image is served far larger than its box *and* its
  `sizes` claims the full viewport, the finding names the attribute as the cause
  rather than reporting the bytes as the symptom. → `browser: images:rendered-size`

## content — pages a site is repeatedly asked for

*Check file: `tools/checks/content.mjs`. Reads built `dist/` HTML, so any routing
convention counts — detection is on what the page renders, not its filename.*

Both practices here are **house style**. A personal Astro blog is not broken for
lacking either, and a tool that says otherwise gets uninstalled. They report
`💡 [baseline]` by default and bind under `--strict`.

- **A media kit.** A small business or project site is regularly asked for "your
  logo and a short description". Without one canonical page that becomes an email
  thread and inconsistent assets in the wild — the wrong logo, a stale
  description, someone's screenshot. It is the one URL you hand to press,
  partners, sponsors and directories. A route matching `/media`, `/media-kit`,
  `/press`, `/presskit`, `/newsroom` or `/brand-kit` must carry three things to be
  worth linking: a downloadable logo asset, a paste-ready paragraph of
  boilerplate, and a contact route or `mailto:`.
  → `content: mediakit` (`⏭` with no `dist/`)

  **The route list is the check's weak point, and it has failed once.**
  tasmanvisa-web got a `🔧` for a missing media kit while serving a full
  bilingual one at `/media/` — the single plain-English name that was not in a
  list of three (issue #17). Two things came out of that. Bare `/media` is now
  accepted, and with a **locale-prefixed translated slug** the name list can never
  be the answer: `/hu/sajto/` matches nothing in English however long the list
  gets. So the check reads the `hreflang` alternates a matching page emits and
  accepts those pages too — the site already declares which pages are each
  other's translations, for search engines, and reading that beats a per-language
  dictionary of the word "press". Broadening a name list also means a page can
  match the *route* and not be the thing (`/media/` as a photo gallery), so among
  several matches the **best** candidate decides, never the first one the walk
  hits: otherwise a site's real media kit gets reported as "page exists but is
  missing a downloadable logo asset", which is a wrong finding rather than a
  missed one.
- **A design reference page.** This is the one that pays off for the agent
  audience. A `/design` (or `/styleguide`, `/design-kit`, `/tokens`) route that
  renders the site's *actual* tokens and components — colours, type scale,
  spacing, buttons, cards, form controls — lets an agent or a new contributor see
  what exists and where it is used without reading every component file. It also
  makes drift visible: rendered from the real tokens, a divergent hardcoded
  colour shows up next to the swatch it should have matched.

  The check asks only that the route exists and renders more than a heading —
  design tokens referenced, colour swatches, or several component sections.
  Detection is deliberately loose, because the risk here is false-positiving on a
  legitimate variant. The strongest version of this page generates itself *from*
  the token source so it cannot drift, but that is site-side work: the auditor
  checks the page is there and is not a stub, and does not try to generate it.
  → `content: designkit` (`⏭` with no `dist/`)
- **Quotes are written, not guessed at.** Astro 7 renders Markdown with Sätteri
  instead of remark, and the two resolve an *ambiguous* straight `"` differently.
  On tasmanvisa-web's Hungarian content the closing quotes flipped to opening
  ones: six posts shipped `„bespoke“` where the pairing is `„…”`. Nothing in the
  build said a word. Writing the quote you mean fixes it permanently, for any
  engine. → `💡 content: quotes:ambiguous`

  **Advisory in every mode** (`policy.mjs` `ADVISORY`, no `🔧` branch at all).
  Correct prose can legitimately mix a straight quote with a directional one — an
  inch mark, an attribute quoted mid-sentence — so this is the one check here
  that can fire on a compliant site, and a check that fails a compliant site is
  what this repo refuses to ship. It reports *where the two engines would
  disagree*; whether that is a bug is the author's call.

  Fenced code and inline backticks are excluded first: no engine touches those,
  and a `const a = "x"` on a page about typography would otherwise be a finding.
  Markdown is found by walking `src/`, not `src/content/` — the starter keeps its
  posts in `src/data/blog/`, and hardcoding the other path is the mistake that
  once made a whole SEO domain silently not run.

## data — the machine-readable surface

*Check file: `tools/checks/data.mjs`. Source: `src/components/SEO.astro`,
`src/lib/jsonld.*`, `src/pages/**`, `src/content.config.ts`. Endpoints are matched
by **pattern**, so single-locale and per-locale naming both pass.*

- **Every collection is schema-validated**, not just one of them. The check was
  a whole-file `/z\.object\(/` on the raw text of `content.config.ts`: two
  collections where only one had a schema passed, and so did a file whose only
  mention of Zod was in a *comment* — the exact failure mode this repo had
  already fixed for meta tags and then repeated here. All five dogfood builds
  found it. Now: comments blanked, each `defineCollection` body checked for a
  `schema:`, and the unschema'd ones named. → `data: content:schema`

  **Blanking comments requires knowing what is a comment**, and the regex that
  did it read a `/*` inside a *string literal* as an opener. The carrier is the
  single most idiomatic line in a Content Layer config —
  `loader: glob({ pattern: '**/*.md' })` — so the blanking ran from the glob
  pattern to the next real `*/`, swallowing the `schema:` key a few lines below
  and reporting a ~35-field Zod schema as absent. It needs *both* halves to
  fire, which is why every two-line test of it looked fine. The scanner is now
  string-aware (`stripComments` in `tools/lib/src-scan.mjs`), and string state
  resets at each newline on purpose: an apostrophe in `.astro` prose ("don't")
  is not a string opener, and letting one span lines would suppress comment
  stripping for the rest of the file — reintroducing the
  comment-satisfies-a-check failure above, which is the worse of the two.
  The blast radius was every `src-scan` consumer, not this check alone.
  Reported by tasmanvisa-web.
- **JSON-LD emitted, covering both core shapes.** The built pages carry
  `application/ld+json` with an Article-family type per post and a site-wide
  `WebSite`. Read from `dist/` and **parsed**, not grepped: the old check required
  a file at `src/lib/jsonld.ts` containing the literal string `BlogPosting`, so
  five independently built sites that all emit rich, valid JSON-LD were all told
  they had none — they named the module differently, inlined it, or chose
  `Article`. Any of `Article`, `BlogPosting`, `NewsArticle`, `TechArticle`,
  `ScholarlyArticle`, `LiveBlogPosting`, `Report`, `CreativeWork` counts; all earn
  the same rich results. `@graph` and top-level arrays are unwrapped.
  → `data: jsonld:emitted`, `data: jsonld:shapes` (`⏭` with no `dist/`)
  Coverage uses the sitemap denominator too. "More than zero" was the old bar:
  one page out of nineteen reported ✅ and exit 0, printing a ratio with no
  threshold to read it against.
- **The JSON-LD parses.** A block that isn't valid JSON is discarded whole by
  search engines while looking perfectly fine in the source — worse than emitting
  none. → `data: jsonld:parses`
- **`/llms.txt`, content-driven.** Some `llms*.txt` endpoint is built from
  `getCollection()` (a multi-locale root may be a thin index pointing at
  per-locale variants — pass if *any* endpoint is content-driven). →
  `data: llms.txt`
- **Published-only filter on the content index.** Drafts and preview-only
  entries must be excluded — accepted as inline `!draft && !previewOnly` *or* a
  factored `isPublished()`-style helper. → `data: llms.txt:filter`
- **RSS feed with items in it.** Judged on the built `rss*/feed*/atom*.xml`:
  does it contain `<item>`s? The endpoint file is only how the feed got there, so
  requiring `getCollection()` *inside* it penalised the better pattern of
  factoring the collection query into a shared helper. Without a `dist/` the
  endpoint's existence is reported, and the message says its output is unverified.
  → `data: rss`
- **A search-index endpoint, if the site has search.** A `search-index*.json`
  endpoint built from `getCollection()` is what a client-side engine loads. Since
  search became optional the check is dependency-aware: no endpoint *and* no
  search library is `⏭`; no endpoint *with* a search library installed is a
  finding, because the site ships a search UI with nothing to feed it. →
  `data: search:index` (pairs with `modules: search:engine`)

**Shared invariant:** one publish predicate — `!draft && !previewOnly` — across
llms, RSS, and search-index, so all three discovery surfaces agree on what's
public.

## analytics — measured privately, and measured at all

*Check files: `tools/checks/analytics.mjs` (offline: source + built `dist/`) and
the `analytics` checks in `tools/checks/live.mjs` (served HTML, `--url`). The
patterns both read live in `tools/lib/analytics-signals.mjs`, so the two cannot
drift.*

**Nothing in this section fails a run.** `analytics: provider` is *advisory by
construction* — it has no `🔧`/`🛑` branch at all, in either mode, and
`tools/lib/policy.mjs` lists it as such so `--rules` says `[advisory]` rather
than implying `--strict` would promote it. Whether a site measures its traffic
is a business decision. The tool reports what delivers analytics — including
when the answer is nothing — and moves on. `tools/test.mjs` asserts the
invariant under `--strict`, because a future refactor could otherwise turn every
unmeasured site into a build failure without a single test going red.

### The default: Cloudflare Web Analytics

- **Cloudflare Web Analytics is the baseline's analytics layer.** It is free, it
  is cookieless, and it does not require a consent banner — so a site can be
  measured the day it deploys, with no dashboard project in front of it. One
  script tag in the root layout:

  ```html
  <script type="module"
          src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js"
          data-cf-beacon='{"token": "<SITE_TOKEN>"}'></script>
  ```

  (Cloudflare `web-analytics/faq`, verified 2026-08-03. A `?token=…` query-string
  form exists too, for tag managers that cannot set attributes.) The beacon
  reports to `/cdn-cgi/rum` on the site's own origin.
  → `analytics: provider`
- **Offline can only ever be advisory about its presence, and not because of the
  severity.** For a proxied site Cloudflare injects the beacon *at the edge* —
  automatic setup is on by default — so a correctly-measured site can have no
  trace of it in `src/` or `dist/`. The served page is the authoritative reader.
  The offline check therefore says what it saw and names `--url` as the thing
  that settles it, rather than concluding.
- **A beacon wired behind an unset token measures nothing.** The common shape is
  a root layout that renders the script only when a token is configured. That is
  correct — but it means "the code is there" and "data is flowing" are different
  claims. When the beacon is in `src/` and in none of the built pages, the check
  says so in those words. `examples/_fixture-i18n` is the standing example: it is
  localhost-only, its token is genuinely `null`, and it carries this `💡`
  permanently rather than being given a fake token to look clean.
- **Auto-install does not reach a Worker.** Cloudflare's automatic injection
  rewrites HTML for proxied *static* responses. A site served by a Worker — which
  is what a Cloudflare Pages/Workers deploy of an Astro build is — is not
  rewritten, so auto-install silently does nothing and the dashboard still shows
  the site as set up. **On a Workers-served site the `<script>` in the root
  layout is mandatory.** This is the single most expensive thing to get wrong
  here, because every surface reports success: the dashboard says installed, the
  build says fine, and no data arrives. Confirm it the only way that means
  anything — `--url` against the deployed site, which reads the served HTML.
  → `analytics: provider` (live)

### The alternative, fully supported: Cloudflare Zaraz

Zaraz is a tag *manager*. Reach for it when you need to run Google Analytics or
other third-party tools and want them gated behind a consent CMP. It is not
worse than Web Analytics; it is a bigger thing, and it is no longer what a site
must set up before it measures anything.

- **Zaraz loads tags at the edge, behind its own consent gate.** It loads Google
  Analytics (and Cloudflare's own analytics) at the edge and holds every tag
  behind its Consent Management Platform — the cookie banner — so nothing fires
  before the visitor agrees. → `analytics: zaraz` (live)
- **The Zaraz loader is only visible at serve time.** Because Zaraz injects at
  the edge, the loader (`/cdn-cgi/zaraz/i.js`) shows up only in served HTML. With
  `--url`, its presence confirms analytics is Zaraz-managed. Without `--url` the
  check reports `⏭`, and says which.
- **The live probe must look like a browser to see Zaraz.** Zaraz has a "Block
  bot initiated requests" setting (bot-score based: block none / automated /
  automated + likely) and Bot Fight Mode does the same — a headerless `fetch` is
  bot-scored as automated, so the edge *correctly* suppresses the loader
  injection for it. A curl-shaped probe therefore never sees Zaraz on a protected
  site, even when it is configured right. So the live GET carries a full browser
  navigation signature (`NAV_HEADERS` in `live.mjs`: Chrome UA, `Sec-Fetch-*`,
  `Sec-Ch-Ua`, `Accept: text/html…`) to get the fully-injected page a real
  visitor receives. Without this the check skips with a false negative.
  → drives `analytics: zaraz`
- **The cookie banner is Zaraz's CMP — no custom banner in the site.** Zaraz
  ships a built-in Consent Management Platform: enable it in the dashboard,
  assign each tool a *purpose*, and Zaraz auto-renders the consent modal, gates
  every tag until the visitor agrees, localises by `Accept-Language`, and is
  styleable via custom CSS. So a site using Zaraz should **not** hand-roll a
  cookie banner — that duplicates what the CMP already does and risks tags firing
  outside consent. The Consent API (`zaraz.consent.*`, the `cf_consent` cookie,
  the `zarazConsentAPIReady` event) is the escape hatch *only* for advanced needs
  — region-scoped modals (e.g. EU-only) or integrating a third-party CMP. (No
  enforcing check: a custom banner isn't reliably detectable in static HTML, and
  the CMP render itself is a Gap below — runtime, needs a browser.)
- **A site on Web Analytics needs no banner at all.** This is the practical
  reason it is the default: cookieless measurement has nothing to consent to, so
  the entire CMP question — build it, configure it, style it, test that tags
  actually hold — does not arise.

### The finding: a snippet that fires before consent

- **No hardcoded Google Analytics / GTM snippet.** A GA or Tag Manager snippet
  pasted into the source fires immediately, outside any consent gate, and
  bypasses Zaraz entirely. The offline check flags it
  (`gtag.js`/`gtm.js`/`analytics.js`/`gtag(`/`GTM-…`/`UA-…`) in `src/` or
  `dist/`. It has two fixes, and the check names both: drop GA for cookieless Web
  Analytics, or deliver GA through Zaraz so the CMP gates it.
  → `analytics: no-hardcoded-ga`
- **Live, only a third-party *loader* counts.** A bare `gtag()` call is not
  flagged against served HTML: when Zaraz delivers GA it injects that bootstrap
  into the rendered page itself, so keying on the call — as the offline scan
  correctly does for *source* — would flag every compliant site. Only a script
  fetched from a Google origin proves the site went around the edge. That is its
  own rule in both branches: reporting the no-Zaraz case under the `zaraz` id
  gave one id three meanings, so nothing could be filtered or suppressed by it.
  → `analytics: ga:raw`
- **Comments are blanked before matching.** A `{/* Cloudflare Web Analytics
  beacon */}` note above an unwired block must not satisfy the *positive* check —
  that would be the tool reporting verified-good where nothing is emitted, which
  is the worst failure it has. The check reads `code` from `lib/src-scan.mjs`,
  not raw text. This class of bug has now been fixed three times in this repo
  (meta tags, then content schemas, then here), which is why it is written down.

## live (`--url`) — what only exists at serve time

*Check file: `tools/checks/live.mjs`. Hits a running/deployed URL.* Re-verifies
the source-level practices against reality: reachability, the real `Cache-Control`
headers, served image bytes (with a browser `Accept`) and transform params, the
rendered SEO surface + JSON-LD on home and a content page, and `/llms.txt`
(served, has an H1, grouped/indexed). Page fetches carry a full browser
navigation signature so edge logic gated on bot score — notably the Zaraz loader
injection — behaves as it does for a real visitor (see `analytics`). Point `--url`
at `wrangler dev` of `dist/` or the deployed site — a plain `astro dev` won't have
the cache headers.

- **The content page is discovered, not assumed to be under `/blog/`.** Order:
  the sitemap (the site's own declaration of its URLs) → same-origin `<a>` links
  on the homepage → `/llms.txt`. Index routes, pagination, tag/category listings
  and non-page extensions are excluded, and the deepest remaining path wins — a
  leaf article over a section landing page. The old check matched `/blog/` only,
  so five sites using `/projects/` and `/wiki/` had ~10 live checks silently not
  run, and two runs printed "audit clean — exit 0" having checked almost nothing.
- **A skip names what it skipped.** When no content page can be found, the `⏭`
  lists the rule ids that did not run. Silence must never be indistinguishable
  from a pass. → `seo: post`
- **The sampled page is one the site itself calls an article.** Discovery reads
  the **feed first** — RSS/Atom is the site's own list of what it considers a
  post — and only falls back to the sitemap, homepage links and `/llms.txt`. The
  sitemap lists every indexable page equally, so "deepest path wins" picked
  whatever sorted first: on matewishkey-web that was `/glossary/agent/`, while
  the `BlogPosting`-carrying `/projects/*` sat right beside it in the same
  sitemap.
- **A page type that isn't an Article is not a missing Article.** A glossary
  entry is a `DefinedTerm`, an FAQ is an `FAQPage`, a recipe is a `Recipe` —
  each is the *correct* markup, and rewriting it as an Article would make the
  page worse. `data: post:jsonld` passes on any of them and says which was
  found, so "this is a definition" and "this is a post" stay distinguishable.

  The generic wrappers are deliberately **not** accepted — `WebPage`,
  `WebSite`, `BreadcrumbList`, `Organization`. They say nothing about what the
  page is, so accepting them would collapse this check into "has any JSON-LD",
  which `jsonld:emitted` already answers. The list lives in
  `tools/lib/jsonld.mjs` (`CONTENT_PAGE_TYPES`). Reported by matewishkey-web.
- **A finding that could not have gone the other way is not a finding.** Neither
  `astro dev` nor `astro preview` applies `public/_headers` — both serve
  `/_astro/*` as `no-cache` whatever the file says — so `perf: cache:_astro`
  against one was guaranteed, unactionable, and (under `--strict`) run-failing.
  It now `⏭`s when the project's own `_headers` declares hashed assets immutable
  *and* the server is local *and* it returned otherwise: three facts that
  together mean "this server ignores the file", not "this site is misconfigured".

  Being local is deliberately not sufficient. `wrangler dev` of the same build
  returns `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` (measured, 2026-08-03, wrangler
  4.118.0 against `examples/starter`), so skipping on host alone would hide the
  finding on the one local server able to produce it. For the same reason the
  *pass* carries no dev-server caveat: an immutable response is something only a
  server that applied the rule can return, so it is proof wherever it came from.
  The caveat now attaches to `perf: cache:html` only when the asset probe showed
  the server ignoring `_headers`.

## lighthouse (`--url`) — the measured score

*Check file: `tools/checks/lighthouse.mjs`. Needs a PSI key.* Where the static
checks confirm "is it wired right?", this answers "what's the real score?" —
PageSpeed Insights Performance/SEO/Accessibility/Best-Practices + lab Core Web
Vitals (LCP/TBT/CLS), plus CrUX field data when the site has enough traffic.
Lab scores are noisy — treat one run as a sample, not a verdict.

- **A score comes with what it means.** "Lab noise" is a real answer and also a
  dangerous one: cypruspokerbrisbane's 5.5 s LCP was dismissed as a harness
  artifact when the cause was a 360 KB Maps iframe. Pulling the full PSI JSON
  settled it in one read, so the three fields that settled it are reported
  instead of discarded — the **LCP element** (what the number is waiting for),
  the **heaviest third-party origins** (weight the site owner did not write), and
  **simulated vs observed** FCP/LCP.
  → `💡 lighthouse: lcp:element`, `third-party:payload`, `metrics:observed`

  The pair is what tells the two cases apart. ~0 ms TTFB with a high FCP means
  the render is blocked by *payload* — go looking for an embed. A completed load
  with an idle main thread but a late **observed** paint is harness variance, and
  the proof in that case was that observed FCP got *slower* after the page got
  lighter.

  All three are advisory by construction (`policy.mjs` `ADVISORY`): they are
  facts about the run, not verdicts. The scores beside them are the verdict.

  **Audit ids are read under both the current and the legacy names, and that is
  load-bearing.** Lighthouse renamed this family to `*-insight`, and PSI serves
  whatever its deployed Lighthouse emits. Measured 2026-08-03 against a live key:
  the response carried `lcp-discovery-insight`, `lcp-breakdown-insight` and
  `third-parties-insight`, and **none** of `largest-contentful-paint-element` or
  `third-party-summary`. The failure mode is the quiet one — a renamed id doesn't
  error, it produces a permanent `⏭`, which reads exactly like "nothing to report
  here". Both id sets are parsed and both are asserted in `tools/test.mjs`.

  The insight shape pays for itself: `lcp-discovery-insight` also carries a
  checklist of the three things that delay an LCP image regardless of its bytes —
  `fetchpriority=high` applied, not `loading="lazy"`, discoverable in the initial
  document. Failures are quoted in Lighthouse's own words rather than re-worded,
  since it is the authority on its own check.


## browser (`--url`) — what only a real browser sees

*Check file: `tools/checks/browser.mjs`. Needs `playwright` installed in the
audited project.* Every other domain reads bytes — source files, built HTML, or
the HTML a server hands back. A page is not its bytes. A script that throws, an
asset that 404s only once the page asks for it, an image downloaded at 4× the box
it lands in, the layout jumping as a font swaps: none of that is in the response,
and all of it is what users actually report. This domain loads the page in
Chromium and measures what happened.

- **`playwright` is deliberately not a dependency of this tool.** It is imported
  dynamically, and the whole domain `⏭`s with the install command when it isn't
  there — the same shape as `lighthouse` without a key. `git clone && node
  audit.mjs` has to keep working with no install step and no browser download; a
  headless Chromium is ~150 MB and cannot be the price of an offline SEO check.
  Resolving from **the audited project** is the load-bearing half: rider is
  normally a clone somewhere else entirely, so a bare `import('playwright')`
  looks in the wrong `node_modules` and reports "not installed" about a project
  that installed it. Playwright's entry is CommonJS, so its exports arrive on
  `default` under ESM — destructuring `{ chromium }` yields `undefined`, which is
  indistinguishable from absent. Both resolutions are tried, and both spellings
  read. → `⏭ browser: playwright`, `browser: launch`

  **This is the tool's one exception to "never executes the audited project's
  code", and it is disclosed rather than hidden.** Importing a driver out of the
  project's `node_modules` means a hostile repository can reach the auditor
  process — which four documents flatly denied until issue #19. The exception is
  bounded: `--url` only (the offline audit never gets here), the auditor's own
  tree is resolved **first** so a project copy loads only when there is no other,
  and the run announces which copy it loaded. Distrust the repo? Omit `--url`.
  → `⏭ browser: playwright:source`, and `SECURITY.md`
- **A measured page is one page, and the output says which.** Everything below
  is measured on the single URL that was loaded, so the domain announces it up
  front rather than letting a homepage sample read as a site-wide verdict. Pass
  `--post <path>` to measure a content page instead. → `⏭ browser: scope`
- **Nothing is measured until the page actually loads.** A navigation that times
  out, hangs on a pending request, or returns a non-2xx is a `🛑 block`, not a
  quiet run of zero findings — a domain that reports "no errors" about a page it
  never opened is the failure this whole file exists to prevent.
  → `browser: load`
- **An uncaught exception is a defect even when the HTML is perfect.** A script
  that throws leaves buttons dead, menus shut and forms inert while every static
  check still passes: the markup it was supposed to animate is right there. It is
  a `🔧`. Console errors are a separate, softer signal — each one is something
  the page tried to do and could not, but plenty are third-party noise, so they
  are `💡`. → `browser: js:errors` (`🔧`), `browser: console` (`💡`)
- **A request the browser could not complete is a missing asset.** 404s on
  sub-resources are invisible to a static read — the HTML referencing them is
  well-formed, and only fetching the page's own request list finds them. A
  connection-level failure is reported differently on purpose: it may be the
  network the audit ran on (an ad blocker, a DNS filter, a captive portal), not
  the site, and the fix text says to re-check from elsewhere before treating it
  as a site bug. Blaming a site for the auditor's network is how a tool loses
  trust. → `browser: requests`
- **"Oversized" means oversized *for its box*, which only a browser knows.** The
  offline checks compare bytes to a fixed budget; a 1280w hero is fine and a
  1280w thumbnail is not, and nothing in the bytes distinguishes them.
  `naturalWidth` over the rendered width does. Over 2.5× is reported.

  The finding names the **cause, not the symptom**, when it can see it: `sizes`
  — not the layout — is what picks a srcset rung, so an overstated `sizes` is
  usually the whole explanation. tasmanvisa-web claimed `100vw` for a card
  rendering at 355 px in a 393 px viewport, and the browser dutifully fetched
  1280w/167 KB where 1000w/133 KB was correct. Advisory: the ratio is a
  heuristic, and art direction can justify it. → `💡 browser: images:rendered-size`
- **Measured CLS outranks inferred CLS.** `perf: cls:img-dimensions` and
  `images: cls` infer shift risk from missing `width`/`height`. This is the real
  number, from `PerformanceObserver`, and it includes what the static reads
  cannot see at all: font swaps, late-injected DOM, embeds that resize
  themselves. Graded on the Core Web Vitals bands (good ≤ 0.1, poor > 0.25).

  When the two disagree, the measurement is the one that is right, and the
  disagreement is a bug in the heuristic. That is not hypothetical: 20 static
  `images: cls` findings landed on a page this check measured at 0.001, all on
  absolutely-positioned fill images that cannot shift anything. The heuristic now
  reads the CSS — see `perf` above and `tools/lib/css-flow.mjs`.
  → `browser: cls:measured`
- **A third party is a domain you don't own, not an origin that isn't this one.**
  `media.example.com` serving your own images is not third-party weight; counting
  it as such would flag the cross-origin image host `perf: preconnect` exists to
  recommend. The comparison is on the registrable domain (approximated —
  this tool ships no Public Suffix List). Over 250 KB per origin is reported,
  advisory: third-party weight blocks your own content, but the call on whether
  a given tag is worth it is the site owner's. → `💡 browser: third-party`
- **Console text and asset URLs are written by the page being audited.** They
  land in whatever reads this output, agent or human, so they are truncated and
  fenced like every other untrusted string the tool relays.
  → `⏭ browser: untrusted-input`

## Gaps / candidate practices (not yet enforced)

The queue. Each becomes a real check when a reporter hits it or we decide it's
worth it — following *How we add a practice* above. Listed so we don't lose them.

**The live queue is the issue tracker**, not this list:
[matewishkey/mwk-rider issues](https://github.com/matewishkey/mwk-rider/issues). Seven
came in from audited sites and were closed on 2026-08-03 by shipped checks —
eager third-party embeds, `dist:size` flagging srcset rungs, CSS
`background-image` (no srcset, no lazy loading), the two remaining font-hygiene
traps, cross-origin `preconnect`, the two Astro 7 changes that build clean and
ship wrong, and a glossary `DefinedTerm` page read as a missing Article. A second
round — three false-firing checks, the missing § browser section, the positive
`srcset` assertion (§ images), a media-kit route list that missed `/media/`
(§ content), and a threat-model claim four files made that the `browser` domain
broke (`SECURITY.md`) — closed on 2026-08-05, when the branch that had been
stranded locally finally reached `main` (PR #20). Only three of those closed
themselves: `Closes #N` fires on the number, and one commit wrote "closes the
four actionable open issues" as prose, so #13–#16 had to be closed by hand.
Worth remembering the next time a commit means to close something.
What is below is the older, quieter half
— plus, where a gap is still open as an issue, the issue is the live record and
the bullet here is only its summary.

- **Astro scoped CSS does not reach `innerHTML`-injected DOM.** A component's
  scoped styles are keyed on a `data-astro-cid-*` attribute the compiler stamps
  on markup it emits; nodes built at runtime and inserted with `innerHTML` carry
  no such attribute, so the rules simply do not apply. It fails silently and
  completely — cypruspokerbrisbane shipped unstyled search rows and an entirely
  unstyled `/search` page this way. The fix is `<style is:global>` namespaced
  under a unique class. Not checked: telling a legitimate `innerHTML` from one
  that needed styling means knowing what the injected markup is, which is a
  runtime question. Worth knowing about; not worth a false positive.
- **`src/fetch.ts` reserved (Astro 7).** Advanced routing is on by default and
  reserves the filename; a pre-existing `src/fetch.ts` that means something else
  must be renamed or `fetchFile` configured. Not checked because a *legitimate*
  v7 advanced-routing handler has exactly the same shape — the check would flag
  compliant sites, which is the one thing a check must never do.
- **Rust compiler HTML strictness (Astro 7).** Unclosed non-void tags now error
  instead of being auto-corrected. Detecting it properly means parsing every
  `.astro` template, which the no-deps tool doesn't do — the build itself is the
  honest gate here.
- **hreflang alternates on multi-locale pages.** Paired-locale posts should emit
  `rel="alternate" hreflang=…` (+ `x-default`); single-locale posts should omit
  the block entirely. The fixture smoke test checks this; the audit doesn't yet.
- ~~**Responsive `srcset`/`sizes`.**~~ Closed by `💡 images: srcset:missing` —
  the practice is § images above. The thresholds that kept it in this list came
  out of a three-build measurement rather than taste; it ships advisory, and
  earns a `🔧` only if a wider sweep shows it staying quiet on correct code.
- **Offline heading scan beyond the canonical gate (see also `headings:order`,
  which now names the component rather than the built page).** Today the offline outline
  check only inspects pages with a `<link rel="canonical">`; a page that should
  be indexable but lacks canonical is invisible to it (the live check still
  covers home + a post).
- **No-negotiation fallback probe (live).** A second `Accept: */*` image probe
  would surface a large raw-source fallback directly; today the offline
  `transform:format` check catches the same `format=webp` smell more cheaply.
- **BreadcrumbList JSON-LD.** The fixture emits it; not asserted by `data`.
- ~~**Runtime behaviour needs a headless browser.**~~ Closed by the `browser`
  domain — the practice is § browser above.
- **Zaraz consent banner actually renders + GA waits for consent.** The
  `analytics` live check confirms the Zaraz loader is present, but the consent
  modal and whether tags hold until consent are decided by client JS at runtime
  (`zarazConsentAPIReady`, the `cf_consent` cookie) — invisible to a `fetch` of
  the HTML, and never to be faked from static HTML. It *used* to be listed here
  as impossible: the tool ran no browser. The `browser` domain does, so what
  keeps this open is that nobody has written the check, not that it can't be
  written — and whoever does should note that `analytics` is advisory by
  construction (`tools/lib/policy.mjs`), so a consent finding is a `💡` however
  certain the browser is about it.
