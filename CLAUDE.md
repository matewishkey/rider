# Mate Wish Key Rider (`rider`) — dev notes for this repo

This repo is **rider**: a single on-demand slash command (`/rider`) that checks an Astro site against baseline best practices. It is *not* a framework — it installs nothing into the sites it audits and never touches their `CLAUDE.md`. You run it when you want a compliance check; it prints findings and suggests fixes.


## What it is

- **One skill, two modes:** `skills/rider/SKILL.md` — a ~10-line router at the top picks **create** (scaffold a new site from `examples/starter/`, steps in `skills/rider/references/CREATE.md`) or **audit** (the rest of the file: load the project's details, run the tool, walk the findings). `install.sh` links the skill *directory* — a file link cannot carry `references/` — and links `SKILL.md` again as the `/rider` command, so the two cannot drift.
- **One tool:** `tools/audit.mjs` — the entry. Detects an Astro project, runs the offline domain checks, and (with `--url`) the live ones. Reports `✅ / 🔧 / 🛑 / 💡 / ⏭` and exits non-zero on findings.
- **Seven offline domains + three `--url` domains**, one module each under `tools/checks/`:
  - `modules` — baseline stack present + wired (version, integrations, `output: 'static'`, strict TS, an adapter iff a route renders on demand); search is optional, two engines at once is a finding.
  - `seo` — canonical SEO component (canonical URL, OG meta), no `keywords`, sitemap lastmod, one `<h1>` per content page (skipped levels = advisory).
  - `images` — content images routed through an image transform + not oversized (`src/assets/` and `dist/`); on built `dist/` HTML, flags Cloudflare transform params (`format=auto` not explicit; explicit `quality=`) + content `<img>` missing `alt` + (advisory) a large image shipping one fixed width with no `srcset` at all, on measured thresholds.
  - `perf` — `/_astro/*` immutable in `public/_headers`; `<img>` carry width/height (CLS) unless CSS takes them out of flow (`tools/lib/css-flow.mjs`); render-blocking CSS + webfont budgets; heavy third-party embeds behind a facade (`tools/lib/embed-hosts.mjs`) — `loading="lazy"` is not one; a cross-origin image host carrying `preconnect` (with `crossorigin`, or the connection isn't reusable) and a head `preload` matching its `<img>`; every declared font family leading a stack with `styles` set.
  - `data` — JSON-LD (an Article-family type + WebSite), `/llms.txt` from the content store, RSS, a search-index endpoint iff a search library is installed, Zod-validated content schema. Endpoints match by pattern (single + per-locale).
  - `analytics` — `provider` reports what delivers analytics (Cloudflare Web Analytics by default — free, cookieless, no banner; Zaraz when you need a tag manager) and is **advisory by construction**: no 🔧/🛑 branch, in either mode. The finding is a hardcoded GA/GTM snippet in `src/`+`dist/`, which fires pre-consent. Both deliveries are edge-injectable, so `--url` is authoritative — see `live.mjs`. Patterns live in `tools/lib/analytics-signals.mjs`.
  - `content` — the pages a site is repeatedly asked for (media kit, design/styleguide — house style, so `💡` unless `--strict`), plus an advisory lint for straight quotes sharing a line with directional ones (what Sätteri and remark resolve differently).
  - `live` (only with `--url`) — real headers, served bytes (browser-realistic `Accept`) + transform-param flags, rendered HTML — `tools/checks/live.mjs`.
  - `lighthouse` (only with `--url`) — measured PSI scores + Core Web Vitals — `tools/checks/lighthouse.mjs`. Needs a free PSI key in `$PAGESPEED_API_KEY`. Skips gracefully without one.
  - `browser` (only with `--url`) — what only a real browser sees: uncaught JS exceptions, failed sub-requests, measured CLS, images oversized for their rendered box — `tools/checks/browser.mjs`. Needs `playwright` installed in the audited project; skips without it. **The tool's one exception to "never executes the audited project's code"** — it imports a driver out of the project's `node_modules` when it has none of its own, so the resolution is auditor-tree-first, disclosed in the output (`browser: playwright:source`) and stated in `SECURITY.md` rather than denied (issue #19). Don't add a second exception.
- **Shared:** `tools/lib/project.mjs` (detect + load), `tools/lib/reporter.mjs` (outcomes + exit code; `💡 suggest` is advisory and never fails the run), `tools/lib/policy.mjs` (universal vs house style), `tools/lib/rules.mjs` (the `--rules` catalogue), `tools/lib/html.mjs` (attrs + the one spec-shaped `srcsetUrls` — never `split(',')`, a Cloudflare transform path is full of commas), `tools/lib/css-flow.mjs` (which elements CSS takes out of flow, so the CLS checks don't fire on absolutely-positioned fill images), `tools/lib/image-size.mjs` (intrinsic dimensions from PNG/JPEG/WebP/AVIF bytes — an unreadable format is a missed finding, never a wrong one, which is why AVIF stopped being acceptable to skip). PSI is the only place the tool talks to an external API, and the only operator secret it reads.

## Working rules

- **Assumes a baseline.** The checks encode the baseline Astro stack (Astro 7+, the integrations, Cloudflare delivery / image transforms, immutable hashed-asset caching). The tool validates compliance against it — it does not set anything up or migrate. The version floor is a deliberate, dated decision — see `BEST-PRACTICES.md` § modules before moving it, and re-verify against npm rather than assuming.
- **Command-driven, never passive.** No contract `@import`, no auto-loading, nothing written into audited projects. If you find yourself wanting an always-on hook or a contract, stop — that's the thing this repo was deliberately stripped of.
- **Surface, don't auto-fix.** Findings are suggestions. Only edit a project when the user asks.
- **Practice ⇒ check (the `BEST-PRACTICES.md` contract).** `BEST-PRACTICES.md` is the *why* behind every check and a living practice↔check registry. Every best practice there has an enforcing check in `tools/checks/*`; a practice with no check is a tracked *gap*, not a practice yet. Adding one = understand the integration (context7) → write the why in `BEST-PRACTICES.md` → bake the check → verify on the fixture (stays `0 🔧`) + a real site → ship. Keep `BEST-PRACTICES.md` § Gaps current.
- **Verify Astro/Cloudflare specifics via `context7`** before writing about them or generating config/code (hard rule).
- **A brand rename does not rewrite evidence.** The docs say Mate Wish Key, but two comments
  still name `wishbusterz.com` — `tools/checks/live.mjs` (the `/glossary/agent/` case behind
  issue #11) and `tools/test.mjs` (the trimmed PSI fixture). Both record a host that really
  answered on 2026-08-03, and `matewishkey.com` does not resolve yet. Renaming them would
  attribute a captured response to a server that never served it. They change when the site's
  DNS does — a find-and-replace over the repo is the wrong tool for a provenance comment.
- **Two example sites, upgraded together.** `examples/_fixture-i18n/` is the multi-locale exerciser (i18n, search, preview routes); `examples/starter/` is the single-locale reference and what create mode copies. Both must be `0 🔧 / 0 🛑` in default **and** `--strict`, and CI runs them as a matrix. **Raising the baseline means upgrading both in the same commit** — a floor moved in one makes the other's clean run a lie. Testing/deploy discipline lives in `docs/DEVELOPING.md`.
- **The starter is the baseline's existence proof, not a second copy of it.** The checks define compliant; `examples/starter/` is a site that is. `references/CREATE.md` describes only the *interaction* and is forbidden from restating the rules — it points at `--rules --json` for what, and `BEST-PRACTICES.md` for why. A third prose copy of the baseline is how all three drift.
- **Create mode copies, never composes.** It copies `~/.claude/rider-starter` verbatim and edits four files. Writing files from memory is exactly how a scaffold stops matching the reference the audit keeps clean; if the link is missing it says "re-run ./install.sh" and stops.

## Install

`./install.sh` creates four symlinks: `skills/rider/` → `~/.claude/skills/rider` (a directory, so `references/` comes with it), `skills/rider/SKILL.md` → `~/.claude/commands/rider.md`, `tools/` → `~/.claude/rider-tools`, and `examples/starter/` → `~/.claude/rider-starter` (what create mode copies). Idempotent. Re-run after `git pull`.
