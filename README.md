# Mate Wish Key Rider

<sub>`mwk-rider`</sub>

An on-demand best-practices auditor for **Astro** sites — and a compliant site to start from. A Claude Code plugin — two slash commands (`/mwk-rider:audit`, `/mwk-rider:create`) over one zero-dependency script, ten domains (seven offline + three live). No framework, no contract, nothing installed into the sites it audits — it reports, you decide.

```
✅ modules: astro:version — ^7.1.6
🔧 seo: meta:canonical — no <link rel="canonical"> in the SEO component
     fix: emit <link rel="canonical" href={canonicalURL}> from src/components/SEO.astro
💡 seo: headings:order — 1/4 content page(s) skip a heading level

38 ✅   1 🔧   0 🛑   1 💡   0 ⏭
audit complete — 1 finding to address (exit 1).
```

## Quickstart

No install, no dependencies, no API key. From the root of any Astro project:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/matewishkey/mwk-rider.git /tmp/mwk-rider
npm run build          # optional, but the image + perf checks read dist/
node /tmp/mwk-rider/tools/audit.mjs
```

That's the whole thing. You get findings like:

```
🔧 perf: cls:img-dimensions (src/pages/index.astro:140) — <img src="/shot.png"> lacks width/height → layout shift (CLS)
     fix: use <Image> from astro:assets (bakes width/height), or add explicit width + height
🔧 data: jsonld:emitted — no <script type="application/ld+json"> in the SEO component
     fix: emit JSON-LD structured data from the SEO component
🔧 data: content:schema — content collection has no Zod schema
     fix: define a Zod schema in src/content.config.ts

16 ✅   5 🔧   0 🛑   12 💡   0 ⏭
12 of the 💡 are [baseline] — this project's house style (Cloudflare delivery, llms.txt, RSS …),
not universal practice. Re-run with --strict to treat them as required.
audit complete — 5 findings to address (exit 1).
```

*(That's a real run against an off-baseline Astro 5 site — not a mock-up.)*

**Want measured PageSpeed scores too?** One free API key ([2 minutes, no billing](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started)) against a publicly reachable URL:

```bash
export PAGESPEED_API_KEY=…
node /tmp/mwk-rider/tools/audit.mjs -s lighthouse --url https://example.com
```

**Want to test the running site in a real browser?** Install Playwright in *your* project and the `browser` domain switches itself on:

```bash
npm i -D playwright && npx playwright install chromium
node /tmp/mwk-rider/tools/audit.mjs -s browser --url https://example.com
```

That catches what no static check can: scripts that throw, assets that 404 only when requested, real measured layout shift, and images served at 4× the size they're displayed.

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for every optional key, and [`examples/ci/audit.yml`](examples/ci/audit.yml) for a copy-paste CI job.

## Required vs suggested

This tool ships an **opinionated baseline** — Cloudflare delivery, Cloudflare Web Analytics, RSS + `llms.txt` endpoints, a particular file layout. Those are defensible choices, but your site isn't *broken* for making different ones.

So by default only **universal practice** is required (`🔧`): missing canonical/OG meta, images without dimensions, no structured data, oversized assets, unschema'd content collections, Astro 7 config that will break your build. Everything that's just house style reports as `💡 … [baseline]` and doesn't fail the run.

```bash
node audit.mjs             # universal practice only — 5 🔧, 12 💡 on a typical site
node audit.mjs --strict    # require the full baseline too — 17 🔧
```

Use `--strict` when you've adopted the baseline deliberately and want it enforced. What counts as which — and why — is one readable table in [`tools/lib/policy.mjs`](tools/lib/policy.mjs); disagree with a call and it's a one-line edit.

A few checks report a *fact* rather than a verdict and are `[advisory]` in **both** modes — `--strict` doesn't promote them, because they have no failing branch at all. `analytics: provider` is the one that matters: it tells you what's delivering analytics, including when the answer is nothing, and never fails a run. Whether you measure your traffic is your call.

`node audit.mjs --rules --json` is the authoritative list of every rule and which of the three it is. Prefer it over any summary written down elsewhere, including this one.

## What it checks

| Domain | What it looks for |
|---|---|
| **modules** | Baseline stack present + wired: Astro 7+, Node ≥ 22.12, the expected integrations, `output: 'static'`, strict TS (≤ 6.x, the `@astrojs/check` peer ceiling), an adapter iff any route renders on demand (`output: 'server'` **or** a single `prerender = false` page) and an explicit `imageService` so the Cloudflare adapter can't opt you into paid image billing; search is optional, but two search engines at once is a finding. Plus Astro 7 migration residue — stabilized `experimental` flags, unified()-only markdown options without `@astrojs/markdown-remark`, `@astrojs/db`, removed `astro:transitions` internals, a `tsconfig` `exclude` that stopped covering `dist`, and `compressHTML` left unset (v7's new `'jsx'` default strips the whitespace between prose and an inline element — it builds clean and ships wrong text). |
| **seo** | A canonical SEO component emitting canonical URL + OG meta; no `keywords` anti-pattern; sitemap lastmod; one `<h1>` per content page (no skipped heading levels — advisory, and it names the component that emitted the heading rather than the built page whenever exactly one source matches). |
| **images** | Content images routed through an image transform (resized/reformatted, not full-size) and not oversized in `src/assets/` or the built `dist/` — a responsive image is judged as a **ladder** on its smallest rung, the one a phone actually downloads, not on the top rung Astro emits unconditionally. A CSS `background-image` pinned to a fixed width is its own finding, since it can use neither srcset nor lazy loading. On built HTML, flags Cloudflare transform params (`format=auto` instead of an explicit format; explicit `quality=`) and content `<img>` missing `alt`. |
| **perf** | `/_astro/*` marked immutable in `public/_headers`; content `<img>` carry width/height (no layout shift); render-blocking CSS on the heaviest page and total webfont weight stay in budget, in woff2. Heavy third-party embeds (Maps, YouTube, Vimeo…) sit behind a facade rather than loading with the page — `loading="lazy"` doesn't count, it won't defer a frame high on the page. Cross-origin image hosts carry a `preconnect` **with `crossorigin`** (without it the connection isn't reusable — it looks fixed and isn't), and a head `preload` matches its `<img>` byte for byte or the image downloads twice. Every declared font family leads a `font-family` stack and sets `styles`, since the API default `['normal','italic']` builds italic faces nothing may render. |
| **content** | The pages a site is repeatedly asked for: a media kit (logo, paste-ready boilerplate, a contact route) and a design/styleguide page rendering the real tokens. Both house style, so `💡` unless `--strict`. Plus a prose lint for a straight quote sharing a line with a directional one — the input Sätteri and remark resolve differently — advisory in **every** mode, because correct prose can do it too. |
| **data** | The machine-readable surface other tools consume: JSON-LD (an Article-family type + WebSite), `/llms.txt` built from the content store, RSS, a search-index endpoint if the site ships a search library, a Zod-validated content schema. Endpoints match by pattern, so single- and per-locale naming both pass. |
| **analytics** | What delivers analytics here — **advisory in every mode**, because whether you measure traffic is your call, not a defect. The baseline default is Cloudflare Web Analytics: free, cookieless, no consent banner. Zaraz is fully supported for when you need a tag manager, and its loader is edge-injected so `--url` is what confirms it. The one *finding* is a hardcoded GA/GTM snippet, which fires before consent. |
| **live** | With `--url`: real Cache-Control headers, served image bytes (measured with a browser-realistic `Accept`) + transform-param flags, rendered SEO + JSON-LD, `/llms.txt` — against a running or deployed site. |
| **browser** | With `--url`: what only a real browser sees — uncaught JS exceptions, requests that failed or 404'd, **measured** CLS, images downloaded far larger than they're displayed, heavy third-party origins. Needs `playwright` installed **in the site you're auditing**; skips cleanly without it. |
| **lighthouse** | With `--url`: real **measured** scores via the PageSpeed Insights API — Performance/SEO/Accessibility/Best-Practices + Core Web Vitals (LCP/TBT/CLS) — plus what makes a stuck score readable rather than dismissable as lab noise: the LCP element, the heaviest third-party payloads, and simulated vs *observed* FCP/LCP. Needs a free PSI key (below); skips gracefully without one. |

The static domains answer *"is it wired right?"*; `lighthouse` answers *"what's the real score?"* — complementary layers.

**This tool assumes a specific baseline** (Astro 7+, static output, Cloudflare delivery, Cloudflare Web Analytics) and validates compliance against it. It does not set anything up or migrate. If your stack differs, the checks are small and readable — fork and adjust.

**The *why* behind every check lives in [`BEST-PRACTICES.md`](BEST-PRACTICES.md)** — a living practice↔check registry. The governing rule: every practice there has an enforcing check, and a practice with no check is a tracked *gap*, not a practice.

## Install

In [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code):

```
/plugin marketplace add matewishkey/mwk-rider
/plugin install mwk-rider@mwk-rider
```

Update later with `/plugin update mwk-rider`. It installs nothing into any project and never touches a project's `CLAUDE.md`.

Requires **Node 22+**. No `npm install` — the tool uses Node built-ins only, and the plugin carries them with it.

## Use

From inside any Astro project, in [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code):

```
/mwk-rider:audit                        # offline: source + dist checks
/mwk-rider:audit https://example.com    # also check the live/served site
/mwk-rider:create                       # scaffold a new site in an empty directory
```

`/mwk-rider:create` scaffolds. It asks three
questions — site name and domain, contact email, a one-line tagline — then copies
[`examples/starter/`](examples/starter), edits them in, builds, and runs
the audit on what it just made. That last step is the point: the starter is kept
at `0 🔧 / 0 🛑` under `--strict` by this repo's own CI, so a scaffolded site is
compliant by construction rather than by intention.

You get a working blog, a contact form that sends real email through Cloudflare
Email Service (free to a verified address, no API key to store), cookieless
analytics, a media kit, a design reference page, RSS, `/llms.txt` and a sitemap
with real `<lastmod>`. Two dashboard steps are left for you, and it says which.

Or call the script directly — it's a plain CLI, Claude Code is optional:

```bash
node /tmp/mwk-rider/tools/audit.mjs --help
node /tmp/mwk-rider/tools/audit.mjs                     # everything offline
node /tmp/mwk-rider/tools/audit.mjs -s seo -s images    # scope to domains
node /tmp/mwk-rider/tools/audit.mjs --url https://example.com  # add live + lighthouse
node /tmp/mwk-rider/tools/audit.mjs --json              # machine-readable
```

`--url` works from **any directory** — the offline domains need an Astro project in the cwd, but a live/lighthouse run only needs the URL.

Outcomes: `✅` pass · `🔧` fixable (required) · `🛑` needs a decision · `💡` optional suggestion · `⏭` skipped. Exit `0` if clean (suggestions don't count), `1` if any required findings, `2` on tooling error — so it drops into CI as-is.

## Optional: `scripts/og.config.mjs`

A few checks read brand details from an optional file at `scripts/og.config.mjs` in the audited project. **You don't need it** — without it, those checks simply don't run. If you have one, this is the shape the tool looks for:

```js
export const config = {
  brand: {
    siteName: 'Example',                 // required by seo: brand.siteName
    siteUrl:  'https://example.com',     // required by seo: brand.siteUrl
    tagline:  'What the site is about',  // required by seo: brand.tagline
    mediaDomain: 'media.example.com',    // enables modules: remotePatterns
    authorName: 'Example',               // optional, richer social cards
    authorUrl: 'https://example.com',
    twitterSite: '@example',
    twitterCreator: '@example',
  },
};
```

Creating this file **adds** required checks (`brand.siteName`, `brand.siteUrl`, `brand.tagline`), so add it only if you want them enforced. The file is read as text and never executed — see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Optional API keys

Both live-API domains skip gracefully when their key is absent; everything else still runs.

**PageSpeed Insights** (`lighthouse`) — set `$PAGESPEED_API_KEY` to a [free PSI key](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started). Note that a single Lighthouse run is **noisy** (lab scores swing run-to-run) and the API needs a **publicly reachable** URL.

The tool only ever *reads* through this API. It never provisions, never writes.

## Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). The short version: `node tools/test.mjs` is the gate, a new check needs both test halves (stays quiet on the compliant example sites **and** fires on a known-bad project), it must be classified in [`tools/lib/policy.mjs`](tools/lib/policy.mjs) or it will start failing strangers' builds, and anything that moves the baseline updates **both** `examples/` sites in the same commit.

Security issues: please use [private reporting](SECURITY.md), not a public issue.

## Safety

The tool is meant to be pointed at projects you don't control, so it **never executes the audited project's source** — config is read as text and parsed, never `import()`ed. It never writes to the project, and makes no network requests unless you pass `--url`.

One documented exception: with `--url`, the optional `browser` domain imports `playwright`, and the copy it finds is usually the audited project's — so a hostile repo can reach the auditor process that way. Leave `--url` off (or use `-s live -s lighthouse`) when auditing something you actively distrust. Details in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
