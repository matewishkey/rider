# rider tools

The engine behind `/rider`. Detects an Astro project, runs domain checks, reports `✅ / 🔧 / 🛑 / 💡 / ⏭`, exits non-zero on findings. Zero dependencies — Node 22 built-ins only.

**The check set moves faster than this page.** `--rules --json` is the authoritative
list of what the tool checks and which of it binds you — it is generated from the code,
so it cannot drift. The table below is orientation, not an inventory.

## Usage

```bash
cd ~/projects/<some-astro-site>

node ~/.claude/rider-tools/audit.mjs            # every offline domain
node ~/.claude/rider-tools/audit.mjs -s seo -s images   # subset
node ~/.claude/rider-tools/audit.mjs --url https://example.com # add live checks
node ~/.claude/rider-tools/audit.mjs --url … --post /wiki/x     # audit that page, not a discovered one
node ~/.claude/rider-tools/audit.mjs --url … --strategy desktop # Lighthouse on desktop (default: mobile)
node ~/.claude/rider-tools/audit.mjs --strict    # require the house-style baseline too
node ~/.claude/rider-tools/audit.mjs --json     # machine-readable
node ~/.claude/rider-tools/audit.mjs --quiet    # hide ✅ lines; findings, 💡 and ⏭ still print
node ~/.claude/rider-tools/audit.mjs --verbose  # show ✅ even when piped or under $CI
node ~/.claude/rider-tools/audit.mjs --rules --json  # every rule id, severity and why; runs nothing
node ~/.claude/rider-tools/audit.mjs --help
```

## Domains

| Domain | Checks |
|---|---|
| `modules` | Astro 7+, Node ≥ 22.12, TypeScript ≤ 6.x, baseline integrations, `output: 'static'`, strict TS (and a `tsconfig` `exclude` that still excludes `dist`), `compressHTML`, `<ClientRouter>`, custom 404, self-hosted fonts, at most one search engine, an adapter iff a route renders on demand (plus the Cloudflare-specific `imageService` call), remotePatterns (if og.config declares a media domain), Astro 7 migration residue (`astro7:experimental`, `astro7:markdown`, `astro7:db`, `astro7:transitions`) |
| `seo` | Head meta emitted (asserted against `dist/` when built, source otherwise); no `keywords` anti-pattern; a canonical that is not shared site-wide; `dist/robots.txt` with a `Sitemap:` line; `<lastmod>` in the built sitemap; one `<h1>` per content page (a skipped level is advisory); brand fields (if og.config present) |
| `images` | `<img>` + CSS `background-image` routed through an image transform, and no background pinned to one width; no oversized raster in `src/assets/`; no oversized built image in `dist/` (a `srcset` judged as a ladder, by its smallest rung); `alt` on every content `<img>`; transform params (`format=auto`, an explicit `quality=`); a large image shipping one fixed width with no `srcset` at all (advisory) |
| `perf` | `public/_headers` marks `/_astro/*` immutable; content `<img>` carry width/height (CLS) unless CSS takes them out of flow; render-blocking CSS on the heaviest page and total webfont weight stay inside budget; woff2 not ttf/otf; every declared font family leads a stack and sets `styles`; a heavy third-party embed sits behind a facade; a cross-origin image host gets `preconnect` (with `crossorigin`) and a `preload` matching its `<img>` |
| `content` | A media-kit page (logo, paste-ready boilerplate, a contact route) and a design/styleguide page that renders the real tokens. Both house style — `💡` unless `--strict` |
| `analytics` | What delivers analytics (Cloudflare Web Analytics by default; Zaraz when you need a tag manager) — advisory, never a finding. Plus a hardcoded GA/GTM snippet in `src/` + `dist/`, which fires before consent |
| `data` | JSON-LD parsed out of `dist/` (an Article-family type + `WebSite`, and it must be valid JSON); `/llms.txt` from `getCollection()` with a draft/preview filter; the built RSS feed has items; Zod-validated content schema |
| `live` | Only with `--url`: real Cache-Control, served image bytes, rendered SEO + JSON-LD, `/llms.txt`. The content page is discovered from the sitemap → homepage links → `/llms.txt`, or forced with `--post` |
| `lighthouse` | Only with `--url`: measured PageSpeed Insights scores (perf/seo/a11y/best-practices) + Core Web Vitals. Needs a PSI key (see below); skips without one |
| `browser` | Only with `--url`: what a real browser sees — uncaught JS errors, failed/404 sub-requests, measured CLS, images far larger than their rendered box, heavy third-party origins. Needs `playwright` installed; skips cleanly without it |

It **assumes a baseline stack** and validates compliance — it does not set anything up.

"The baseline" throughout these docs means: Astro 7+, `output: 'static'`, Cloudflare
delivery (Image Transformations, immutable hashed assets) and Cloudflare Web
Analytics. Search is optional. Checks that only make sense on that stack report as
`💡 [baseline]` by default and are required only under `--strict` — so a site built
differently still gets useful answers. See `../BEST-PRACTICES.md`.

## Lighthouse key resolution

The `lighthouse` domain calls the PageSpeed Insights API and needs a free key: set
`$PAGESPEED_API_KEY`. That environment variable is the only secret the tool reads, and
the only place it talks to an external API.

No key → the domain `⏭ skips` (everything else still runs). Score → outcome: `≥90 ✅`, `50–89 💡`, `<50 🔧`. Transient PSI `500`s get up to 3 attempts (2 retries).

## Outcomes

```
✅  pass      compliant
🔧  fix       mechanically fixable (required)
🛑  block     needs a decision (required)
💡  suggest   optional / nice-to-have (advisory)
⏭   skip      not run / not testable here
```

Exit: `0` clean (💡 suggestions don't count) · `1` findings (🔧/🛑) · `2` tooling error.

## Reading `--json`

`id` identifies the **rule**, not the row. One rule fires as many times as it
finds something — five `modules/dep` rows, one `images/alt` row per offending
page — so `id` is what you filter, suppress and report by, and it is stable
across releases. An individual finding is `(id, source, file/line or url)`;
`name` carries the subject (`dep:@astrojs/rss`) and is for humans.

`file`/`line`/`url` appear only when the finding has a location: a project-level
check like `modules:engines.node` has none, and an empty field would be noise.
`source` is `offline` or `live`, which is how the two `images:alt` rules — one
reading `dist/`, one reading served HTML — stay apart in a combined run.
